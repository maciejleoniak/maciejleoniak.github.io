                <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
                <p>My journey in the world of technology began with a fascination for how software can transform ideas
                    into reality.</p>
                <p> Over the years, I've honed my skills in various aspects of software testing, from manual testing to
                    automated test script development.
                    My expertise lies in designing and executing comprehensive test plans that ensure the reliability,
                    performance, and security of software applications.</p>

                <h2>My Tech Stack </h2>
                <p>Each product is unique, with its own set of business requirements and challenges.
                    To meet these diverse needs, I employ a diverse technology stack.</p>
                <p>This approach enables me to customize solutions effectively, ensuring that each product has the
                    appropriate technological foundation in test automation.</p>
